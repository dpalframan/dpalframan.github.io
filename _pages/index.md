I'm a CPU architect in Austin, TX. I'm passionate about high performance architectures, memory systems, clever solutions, and well-written code. I'm always looking for better and more efficient ways to do things. I received my PhD in computer engineering from the University of Wisconsin--Madison, with my dissertation work focusing on design for reliability. Since beginning my career in industry, I have immensly enjoyed modeling and developing state-of-the-art prefetching and caching hardware. I'm currently part of the server performance group at AMD.
